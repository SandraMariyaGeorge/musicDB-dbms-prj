# Music Streaming Platform Database System (DBMS Micro Project)

This project is part of a DBMS (Database Management Systems) micro project, where the backend is built using Node.js, Express, and PostgreSQL, and the frontend is an admin panel built with React. The system manages music-related data, such as songs, artists, users, playlists, and genres, for a music streaming platform.

## Project Structure

- **Frontend (React Admin Panel):** A React application for managing music data via an admin panel.
- **Backend (Node.js + Express):** A REST API built with Node.js and Express to interact with a PostgreSQL database for CRUD operations.
- **Database:** PostgreSQL database (hosted locally using Supabase) to store users, songs, artists, playlists, and genres.

## Technologies Used

- **Frontend:** 
  - React
  - Axios (for API calls)
  
- **Backend:**

  - Express.js
  - PostgreSQL (Supabase)
